We can use the pull() function so we don’t get pages of output for a single column and can easily see the names.\n\ngapminder |&gt; \n  distinct(country) |&gt; \n  pull()\n\n  [1] Afghanistan              Albania                  Algeria                 \n  [4] Angola                   Argentina                Australia               \n  [7] Austria                  Bahrain                  Bangladesh              \n [10] Belgium                  Benin                    Bolivia                 \n [13] Bosnia and Herzegovina   Botswana                 Brazil                  \n [16] Bulgaria                 Burkina Faso             Burundi                 \n [19] Cambodia                 Cameroon                 Canada                  \n [22] Central African Republic Chad                     Chile                   \n [25] China                    Colombia                 Comoros                 \n [28] Congo, Dem.

Instead of Russia, we’ll examine Bulgaria, Japan, United States. We’ll create a new tibble called three_countries to store our restricted data. Since we are looking at life expectancy changes over time, the three columns we’ll need are country, year, and lifeExp.\n\nthree_countries &lt;-  gapminder |&gt; \n  select(country, year, lifeExp) |&gt; \n  filter(country %in% c(\"Bulgaria\", \"Japan\", \"United States\"))\n\nNow we can use ggplot to create our chart.\n\nthree_countries |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = country))\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Exercise 2\n\nModify the code below to add a title to the plot, create a more meaningful y-axis label, and use theme_minimal() to change the theme of the plot.\n\nRefer to the Getting Started chapter, which is when we first labeled the axes and added a title to plots.\n\nthree_countries |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = country))\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Exercise 3\n\nIn the empty code chunk below, create the same graphic using three new countries of your choosing. Set the chunk option to render the plot, but not the code.\n\n\n# insert code here\n\n\n2.4 Exercise 4\n\nTry to recreate the plot and the linked reference to it shown below.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Life expectancy trend - Bulgaria, Japan, United States\n\n\n\nYou can see in Figure 1 that Bulgaria’s life expectancy increase slowed starting in the mid 1960s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\nuse the chunk option fig-cap: \"Write your caption here\" to replicate the caption towards the bottom of the plot.\nuse the chunk option label: fig-unique_label_name to make a label that becomes cross-referenceable. Ideally, unique_label_name should be something unique and meaningful like three_country_life_exp. The fig- prefix is required to properly cross reference figures.\nAfter the code chunk with the label has been run or rendered, in the visual editor, you should be able to select Insert -&gt; Cross Reference to place it in the narrative text. It will default as link to “Figure 1” which is the first labeled figure in the document.\n\n\n\n\n# insert code here\n\n\n2.5 Exercise 5\n\nCopilot doesn’t suggest completions when in Visual mode.\nInsert a code chunk below using Insert -&gt; Exectuable Cell -&gt; R in the visual editor, then switch to Source mode.\nWhile in source mode, type the following comment line: # Create a plot of life expectancy over time for the United States and Portugal.\nIn the narrative below the plot, describe how well Copilot did.\n\n\n2.6 Exercise 6\n\nIn the YAML section at the top of the document, replace the author’s name with your own.\n\n\n2.7 Exercise 7\n\nPublish your document to quarto.pub and copy/paste the link to the Lab 1 assignment in Brightspace."
